# User Stories (at least 2)

**User Story 1:**  
As a computer science student,  
I want to input two numbers, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and see the results,  
so that I can understand how basic machine language operations manipulate data and apply these concepts to learn about computer architecture.

**User Story 2:**  
As a computer science student,  
I want to input a number, check if it is positive, negative, or zero, and then direct the flow of the program based on these conditions,  
So that I can understand how conditional branching works in machine language.
