Functional Requirements:
The system must initialize a 100-word memory array at the start of the program.
The BasicML program must be loaded into memory starting at location 00.
Users must be able to input a word from the keyboard into a specific memory location.
The system must display the word from a specific memory location on the screen.
Words from specific memory locations must be loadable into the accumulator.
Words from the accumulator must be storable into specific memory locations.
The system must perform addition operations with the accumulator and specific memory locations.
The system must perform subtraction operations with the accumulator and specific memory locations.
The system must perform division operations with the accumulator and specific memory locations.
The system must perform multiplication operations with the accumulator and specific memory locations.
The system must change the instruction pointer to specific memory locations when prompted.
The system must conditionally change the instruction pointer based on the accumulator's value.
Program execution must stop upon reaching the HALT instruction.
Users must be able to input, edit, and save BasicML programs through the GUI.
The GUI must allow users to start, pause, and reset the simulation of BasicML programs.


Non-Functional Requirements:

The system must execute instructions within 100 milliseconds, ensuring the simulation process runs efficiently, otherwise display a please wait message till the execution is complete.

The GUI must include clearly labeled controls, tooltips, and a structured layout to facilitate program input and output viewing.

The system must display error messages and continue running without crashing when invalid operations are performed.
