Functional Requirements:

1. The system shall handle text from input file that cannot be parsed.
2. Users must be able to input, edit, and save BasicML programs through the GUI.
3. The GUI must allow users to start, pause, and reset the simulation of BasicML programs.
4. The system shall have 3 accumulators to handle a larger volume of system operations.
5. The system shall check for invalid user input.
6. The system shall verify that no mathematical operation will exceed four digits in length.
7. The system shall verify that file exist and is accessable. 
8. The system shall orginize the operations in a way where the instructions and the memory is divided into two locations in memory.
9. The system must display the word from a specific memory location on the graphical user interface.
10. The system shall allow the user to change the instruction pointer to a specific memory location when prompted.
11. The system shall allow the user to input a two digit character string.
12. The system shall convert character strings into four digit numbers.
13. The system shall convert four digit numbers into two digit characters.
14. The system shall save every input file entered into the program.
15. The system shall set accumulator to zero if designated number in memory matches the accumulator.


Non-Functional Requirements:

1. The system must execute instructions within 100 milliseconds, ensuring the simulation process runs efficiently, otherwise display a please wait message till the execution is complete.
2. The GUI must include clearly labeled controls, tooltips, and a structured layout to facilitate program input and output viewing.
3. The system must display error messages and continue running without crashing when invalid operations are performed.
